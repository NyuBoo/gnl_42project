# Compiler.sh
I have created a compile.sh for you to make your tests in a faster way

# Uses
- Compiles (with flags) your program, adding everything that is necessary and the main function.
- You can change 'BUFFER_SIZE=2' to any parameter you want or even remove it.
- Call the generated ./a.out and print the results.

# Careful
In case your main is inside your get_next_line.c, you should remove it from the script.
This not works for bonus. In case you want to prove it, you sould modify the script according to your needs.
